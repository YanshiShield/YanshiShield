# Quick Start

In this tutorial, we use the classic MNIST training example to introduce how to use Neursafe FL for federated training in standalone mode. Please follow the [building](build.md) and [installation](install.md) instructions to complete the installation of Neursafe FL in standalone scenarios first.



## Prepare dataset

### 1. Enter Neursafe FL code

```shell
cd federated-learning
```



### 2. Create directory for Minist dataset

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/nsfl
```



### 3. Download MNIST dataset

Download the MNIST dataset according to  the underlying machine learning framework.

```shell
#for tensoflow
python3 example/data/mnist/prepare_tf_data.py --path /tmp/nsfl/data/mnist/tf/

#for pytorch
python3 example/data/mnist/prepare_torch_data.py --path /tmp/nsfl/data/mnist/torch/
```



## Prepare configuration files

Run the following command to generate the configuration for the Coordinator and Clients of the federated learning job:

```shell
python3 example/scripts/gen_mnist_config.py --job_name=tf_mnist \
--workspace=/tmp/nsfl/ \
--coordinator_port=8090 \
--client_ports=9091,9092 \
--runtime=tensorflow \
--platform=linux \
--rounds=20 \
--dataset=/tmp/nsfl/data/mnist/tf/mnist.npz
```

Parameter description:ï¼š

| parameter name   | description                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| workspace        | Specify the workspace directory of the federated job to store the configuration files and training scripts required by the federated job and the intermediate data produced in federated training |
| coordinator_port | Specify port of the coordinator                              |
| client_ports     | Specify multiple client ports separated by ",", how many ports are configured means that how many clients required configuration files will be generated |
| runtime          | Specify the deep learning framework used by the federated job, supporting tensorflow or pytorch |
| platform         | Specify the running platform of the federated learning job, supports linux (running in local process mode) and k8s (running in cluster mode) |
| rounds           | Specify the number of training epochs for federated learning jobs |
| dataset          | Specify the dataset path for federated learning job          |

The generated configuration is in the form of json and stored in the location specified by the workspace parameter, as follows:

 ![](images/example-mnist-dir.png)



### Dataset configuration:

The dataset configuration file is named datasets.json, which describes the relationship between dataset name and dataset path, such as:

```json
{
    "mnist": "/datasets/mnist",
    "cifar10": "/datasets/cifar10"
}
```

### Job script configuration:

Job script configuration, which describes the path of the training script executed by the client, the path of the evaluation script, and the corresponding script parameters, such as:

```json
{
        "script_path": "/workspace/example/scripts/tf_mnist", # Storage paths for training scripts and evaluation scripts
        "train": {
                "timeout": 30,  # Waiting for the timeout time for script execution, if the timeout is still not over, it is considered that the operation failed
                "command": "python3.7", # command executed by the script
                "entry": "train.py", # entry point for script execution
                "params": null # The parameters of script execution, describe the parameters in the form of a dictionary, such as {"--index_range": "0,5000"}
        },
        "evaluate": {
                "timeout": 30,
                "command": "python3.7",
                "entry": "evaluate.py",
                "params": null
        }
}
```

Note: The file name of the job configuration must be the same as the value specified by "task_entry" in the federated job (refer to [Job object description](apsi.md) for its meaning). If the value of "task_entry" in the job is "tf_mnist", then The file name of the job configuration is tf_mnist.json



## Prepare the federated learning script

The Neursafe FL migrate machine learning to federated by adding some API calling in traning  script,  as follows:

- Before loading the training data, call the get_dataset_path interface to obtain the local training data path, as NOTE 1.
- When loading model parameters, use Nerusafe FL's load_weights to replace the original implementation, and load the model parameters delivered from the Coordinator, as  NOTE 2.
- After completing the local training , call commit_weights to report the updated model parameters to the Coordinator, as  NOTE 3.
- Call the commit_metrics interface to submit some statistical data of federated training, such as accuracy, loss, etc. , as NOTE 4.



```Python
import neursafe_fl as nsfl
from tensorflow import keras as ks
import tensorflow as tf

mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist

# [NOTE 1]
data_path = nsfl.get_dataset_path("tf_mnist")
(x_train, y_train), (_, _) = mnist.load_data(data_path)

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.2),
tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# [NOTE 2]
nsfl.load_weights(model)
history = model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=1)
print('loss', history.history['loss'])
print('accuracy:', history.history['accuracy'])

# [NOTE 3]
nsfl.commit_weights(model)

metrics = {
'sample_num': len(x_train),
'loss': history.history['loss'][-1],
'accuracy': history.history['accuracy'][-1]
}

# [NOTE 4]
nsfl.commit_metrics(metrics)
```



## Run federated learning

Optionally run federated training jobs as  processes or containers.

### Run in process

#### 1. Run first client

```shell
 ./deploy/scripts/run_client.sh /tmp/nsfl/client_0/tf_mnist.json
```

#### 2. Run Second client

```
 ./deploy/scripts/run_client.sh /tmp/nsfl/client_1/tf_mnist.json
```

#### 3. Run Coordinator

```
./deploy/scripts/run_coordinator.sh /tmp/nsfl/coordinator/tf_mnist.json
```



### Run in container

#### 1. Run first client

```shell
docker run -v /tmp/nsfl:/tmp/nsfl --net=host nsfl-client-cpu --config_file /tmp/nsfl/client_0/tf_mnist.json
```

#### 2. Run second client

```sh
docker run -v /tmp/nsfl:/tmp/nsfl --net=host nsfl-client-cpu --config_file /tmp/nsfl/client_1/tf_mnist.json
```

#### 3. Run Coordinator

```shell
docker run -v /tmp/nsfl:/tmp/nsfl --net=host nsfl-coordinator --config_file /tmp/nsfl/coordinator/tf_mnist.json
```



## Federated learning process

After executing the above command, we can see the cooperation process of federated learning in the output of the client and coordinator, as shown below:

### 1. Client 1

![client1](images/example-mnist-client1-process.png)



### 2. Client 2

![client2](images/example-mnist-client2-process.png)



### 3. Coordinator

![coordinator](images/example-mnist-coordinator-process.png)



### 4. Result

This example demonstrates that two clients participate in Federated training. After training, the final model and metrics will be saved in directory /tmp/nsfl/coordinator/tf_mnist/fl_tf-mnist_output_V0:

![result](images/example-mnist-result.png)

Among them, checkpoint_ 20.h5 is the final model weight after 20 rounds of federated training, metrics.json  records the accuracy, loss and other information of the model.
