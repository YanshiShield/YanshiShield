## Model Management

APIs to access the model manager, which is used to manage the model meteadta in user-space in the federated learning system, including the initial model uploaded by the user, the checkpoint generated during the training process, and the final trained model, etc.

```
Note: Model management only manages the meta information of the model. The upload and download of the model data need to access API according to your backend data storage scheme. If your backend supports s3 standard object storage, then we strongly recommend that you use the 'cli' tool we provide. The 'cli' tool provide a complete model management solution, including the data downlond and upload.
However, if you use other backend storage solutions, you should wrap a script yourself to provide full model management functionality, especially the data upload and download. At the sametime, access our model managers API to maintain your model data metadata.
```
